The group is focused on research related to MS and aims to investigate access to health services in the LGBTQ+ population with MS in Argentina. The conference includes a session about global perspectives and pressing issues in MS, and the group suggests that eradicating global disparities are critical for a world without MS. The group is made up of members from around Europe and aims to bring the MS community voice and perspective to the conference to ultimately make life better for people with MS. The conference is taking place in Milan, Italy, and is expected to attract esteemed figures in the field of MS.","Global Health Disparities & Mental Awareness Conference in Milan, 2023","Title: ""MS Milan Congress: Investigating Access to Health Services in the LGBTQ+ Population with MS in Argentina""","see you next year in denmark! ms milan multiple sclerosis msguncel,

1,"The scientific summary of the ECTRIMS conference highlights the need to reclassify multiple sclerosis (MS) as a virus instead of an autoimmune disease. Research shows that infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may prime the immune system to accidentally attack a brain protein called Ano2, leading to MS. To cure and prevent MS, it is necessary to understand its origin and develop effective treatments. While EBV may be necessary but not sufficient to cause MS, there are many ways to cure diseases, and knowledge of the cause is not always necessary. The conference also explores topics such as the gut microbiome, biomarkers, potential future therapeutic targets, environmental, genetic, and epigenetic risk factors, and the relationship between EBV and MS.",Impact of Epstein-Barr Virus on the Immune System and Gut Health as Risk Factors for Diseases.,Title: ECTRIMS Conference Highlights Need to Reclassify Multiple Sclerosis as a Virus,"yes judging by the science revealed at ectrims we need to strat calling ms a virus instead of autoimmune,

6,"The European Congress of Neurology (ECN) in Milan provided more evidence for treating depression early after multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis. The progression of the disease is independent of disease activity, and the inflammation in the brain can cause depression. Proper MS management is important for mental health, and dietary management can delay the onset and manage already present comorbidities. Fatigue is a crucial topic in MS, and patient-reported measures are the gold standard. Sleep disorders have a significant impact on other MS symptoms, and cognitive rehabilitation or exercise may improve processing speed in individuals with progressive MS. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help depression and anxiety in people with MS, and atrophy in the hippocampus and elevated cortisol can increase depression in MS. Adjustment to diagnosis and/or FX change can feel like being hit by a tornado, and the prevalence of mental health conditions in MS is 3-4 times higher than the general population.","Managing Depression, Fatigue, and Comorbidities: A Review of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Symptomatic Management",Title: Evidence for Early Treatment of Depression in Multiple Sclerosis: European Congress of Neurology in Milan,"provided more evidence for treating depression early after multiple sclerosis diagnosis at ec trims. progression independent of disease activity #pira was all the talk in ms milan with breaking down the pathways and opportunities for early tx!,

15,"This work identifies a longitudinally stable autoantibody profile that is present before, during, and after the first symptom onset for a subset of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). The study also discusses the role of the thalamus as a relay station and thalamic atrophy in MS. The speaker, Professor Stephen Hauser, gave an opening lecture at the MS Milan conference, discussing patterns of autoimmunity in different conditions and the potential implications for MS. The lecture also covered the genetic loci for MS susceptibility and severity, as well as the advancements in molecular medicine for MS. The speaker also presented new data at the conference reflecting the long-standing commitment to advancing the science in MS and improving the treatment experience for everyone living with the disease.",Stephen Hauser's research on autoantibodies and potential cure for autoimmune diseases.,Title: Longitudinal Autoantibody Profile and Thalamic Atrophy in Multiple Sclerosis: A Study and Lecture by Professor Stephen Hauser at the MS Milan Conference.,"there are several cures for ms,

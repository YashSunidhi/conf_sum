7,"Back and forth we go....it's perplexing to see how these studies go round and round with DMT's slowing progression / not slowing progression. DMT's work best when progression is mainly driven by inflammation, rather than by neurodegeneration. We need new ideas for DMT's that slow or prevent the neurodegeneration type of progression. DMTs Ease SPMS Disability Early But Not Over Time Continuing treatment not found to slow long-term disability progression ""Results showed that patients in the treatment group had lower EDSS scores at the index date, reflecting a lower degree of disability, and that these scores tended to remain lower over the course of follow-up. However, scores generally increased for all patients over time, and the rate of disability progression was not significantly different in treated versus untreated patients. This meant that treated patients had less disability in the earlier stages of their disease, but treatment did not slow the progression of their disease at later stages. ‚ÄúNon-treated SPMS patients have generally higher EDSS values than treated patients, suggesting a beneficial effect of DMTs in slowing disease accumulation at earlier stages of the progressive phase,‚Äù Pontieri said. ‚ÄúHowever, as patients get older, staying on DMTs does not seem to slow [disability progression].‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile DMTs might be beneficial in SPMS patients at earlier stage of progression, their effect might fade away as patients get older, stressing the importance of earlier recognition and intervention of progressive transition,‚Äù the team concluded."" #ECTRIMS2022 ‚Äì DMTs Ease SPMS Disability Early But Not Long | Continuing Treatment Won't Slow Long-term Disability Progression | Multiple Sclerosis News Today PPMS for 24 years (dx 1998) ~ Worrying will not take away tomorrow's troubles ~ But it will take away today's peace. ~
After 5 years on Betaseron (which was relatively ineffective for me), followed by 11 years on Copxone (which worked much better for me), I chose to discontinue DMTs in 2019, at the age of 57. My last MS flare (and probably the last time I had inflammation in my brain) was in 2014. Although I was without flares after 2014, I noticed steady decline in my abilities. I started seeing a functional medicine doctor in 2018 and significantly changed my diet and tried to rid my household and lifestyle of toxins, stress, etc. I try to exercise regularly and moderately (although I'm not as successful at that as I wish I was.) I have remained relatively stable since 2018 (with the exception of 2020 when group exercise options were unavailable and I didn't substitute much at home with alternate exercise). I don't regret going off DMTs. I no longer believed they were effective for me after I reached SPMS. I currently do not have a need for assistive devices when I'm in my own home. But I use a cane when I leave the house; I need it when I go down curbs, walk on uneven ground, etc. I use a walker if I go to a park and need to walk on grass. I use a power chair for museums, zoos and other activities that involve much walking; I am unable to walk more than about a block. ~ Faith MSWorld Volunteer -- Moderator since JUN2012 (now a Mimibug) Symptoms began in JAN02 - Dx with RRMS in OCT03, following 21 months of limbo, ruling out lots of other dx, and some ""probable stroke"" and ""probable CNS"" dx for awhile. - In 2008, I was back in limbo briefly, then re-dx w/ MS: JUL08 . - Betaseron NOV03-AUG08; Copaxone20 SEPT08-APR15; Copaxone40 APR15-present - Began receiving SSDI / LTD NOV08.

44,"Immune ablation with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) was not superior to natalizumab in reducing disability progression or allowing reduction of disability in patients with progressive MS. This was the main result from a non-randomized study comparing pairwise-censored groups. What is known about the effectiveness of AHSCT in progressive MS mostly comes from results of studies that focused on relapsing-remitting MS. In fact, at ECTRIMS 2022, Dr. Tomas Kalincik (Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia) presented results of a study comparing AHSCT with 3 high-efficacy DMTs in relapsing-remitting MS. Now Dr. Kalincik explored the effectiveness of AHSCT in progressive MS and compared it with a singly, high-efficacy therapy, namely natalizumab [1]. This comparator was chosen for pragmatic reasons. Patients with secondary or primary progressive MS from 6 AHSCT MS centers around the world plus patients from the MSBase registry could participate. They were included if they received AHSCT or started natalizumab during progressive MS. A total of 39 patients treated with AHSCT (37 with SPMS, 2 with PPMS) were matched with 139 natalizumab users. The pairwise-censored groups were compared on annualized relapse rates (ARR), freedom from relapses, and cumulative hazards of 6-months confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) worsening and improvement. Dr. Kalincik stressed that on average, participants had moderately advanced disease, with a mean EDSS of 5.7 and a mean 0.5‚Äì0.6 relapses in the preceding year. There was a follow-up of up to 6 years. Results showed that ARR while on treatment was low in both groups (both 0.08). HR for relapses was 1.04 (95%CI, 0.39 ‚Äì 2.82; p = 0.92). This result was corroborated by the similar cumulative hazards of having a relapse at year 2 (AHSCT 20%, natalizumab 14%) and at year 5 (31% and 34%, respectively). Confirmed EDSS worsening was relatively prevalent in both groups (HR 1.49; 95% CI 0.70‚Äì3.14; P=0.30). HR for improvement, which rarely occurred, was 1.49 (95% CI 0.22‚Äì10.28; P=0.67). In the AHSCT group, 3 patients (7.7%) had febrile neutropenia during mobilization, 9 (23%) had serum sickness, 6 (15%) required ICU admission, and 36 (92%) experienced complications after discharge, including 21 infections. There were no treatment-related deaths.

84,"Ibudilast has a significant beneficial effect on slowly evolving lesions (SELs) in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), new data suggest. Through its effect on SELs, ""we have a suspicion that ibudilast may be exerting some of its protective effect by abrogating chronic active lesions,"" study investigator Daniel Ontaneda, MD, Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis at Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, told Medscape Medical News. The findings were presented at the 38th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) 2022. First-in-Class Agent Chronic active lesions (CALs) contribute to clinical worsening among patients with MS. SELs have been proposed as a biomarker for CALs and have been associated with worsening disability. Ibudilast is an investigational, first-in-class, orally bioavailable small-molecule phosphodiesterase-4 and -10 inhibitor and macrophage migration inhibitory factor inhibitor. As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, the drug has shown promise as a treatment for progressive MS in the phase 2 multicenter SPRINT-MS trial. In the new analysis, Ontaneda and colleagues assessed the effect of ibudilast on SELs on MRI scans using data from 195 SPRINT-MS participants with primary or secondary progressive MS. Ninety-seven patients received oral ibudilast (up to 100 mg/d), and 98 received matching placebo. At baseline, the mean SEL volumes were 1.08 mL in the ibudilast group and 1.49 mL in the placebo group. Overall, treatment with ibudilast was associated with a significant 26% decrease in SEL volume (P = .004). There was some evidence that the impact was greater for patients with primary progressive MS. Collectively, the data continue to suggest a beneficial effect of ibudilast in MS, the researchers report. ""Tantalizing"" New Data Reached for comment, Shiv Saidha, MBBCh, MD, professor of neurology, Division of Neuroimmunology and Neurological Infections, Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, said ibudilast is a ""promising therapy with a novel mechanism of action thought to reduce activation of microglia. ""It's hypothesized that the enlargement of these slowly evolving lesions, which correlate with disability accumulation, might be related to ongoing microglial inflammation and this drug might reduce that, which is tantalizing,"" Saidha, who was not involved in the study, told Medscape Medical News. Saidha said it's also ""fascinating"" that ibudilast seems to consistently have a greater impact in primary progressive MS than secondary progressive MS. ""It raises all sorts of questions about the pathobiological underpinnings of these two subtypes of the disease that many of us conventionally think of as being very similar to one another pathobiologically. ""But maybe either they're pathobiologically not as similar as we think, or in order for the for these drugs to be beneficial in secondary progressive MS, they need to be given much earlier,"" Saidha commented.

87,"A new study suggests B-cell depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as ocrelizumab may be safe when used before or during the first trimester of pregnancy and/or during lactation. Anti-CD20 mAbs do not seem to have a depleting effect on the physiological B-cell development in exposed infants. Exposure in the second or third trimester can lead to B-cell depletion. B-cell-depleting therapies are widely applied in hemato-oncological and auto-immune diseases such as MS and NMOSD. Rituximab even features among the 10 most used mAbs overall. However, data on the reduction of B-cells in newborns after different exposure windows before or during pregnancy or breastfeeding are extremely scarce. As a result, anti-CD20 mAbs have a very conservative label regarding pregnancy. This is very impractical in daily practice and increases the risk of disease progression in the mother. Prospective data, presented by Dr. Carolin Schwake (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany), included results from 44 infants (22 girls and 22 boys) who were exposed to anti-CD20 mAbs before or during pregnancy and the lactation period, or only during lactation. B-cell counts and adverse effects were analyzed from the 44 infants. Results indicated that 41 infants were exposed before or during pregnancy (33 to ocrelizumab, 6 to rituximab) and during lactation (1 rituximab, 3 ocrelizumab). On average, there were 49.6 days between exposure and the last menstrual period in the 33 women who were exposed to an anti-CD20 mAb before pregnancy and 44 days in 8 women who took the medication during pregnancy. B-cell analysis was done on average 19 days postpartum. Mean postnatal B-cell values were within the normal range (782.6 ¬± 440.7/¬µl; 15.9 ¬± 6.8%). In 2 cases, ocrelizumab exposure in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy resulted in complete B-cell depletion, but complete repopulation was seen after 2 months of follow-up. There were no congenital malformations or severe infections during the first year of life. In 3 cases, exposure was limited to lactation (1 ocrelizumab, 2 ofatumumab). This had no effect on the B-cell count of the infants (1,121.7/¬µl ¬± 50.5). Dr. Schwake concluded that active attempts of conception can be planned shortly after infusion/injection of anti-CD20 mAb. In the second or third trimester, these drugs can cross the placenta and result in B-cell depletion in the infant. During this period, exposure should therefore be monitored and live vaccines postponed. * Schwake C.

88,"Anti-CD20 therapies do not fully resolve chronic, active/smoldering lesions, visible on MRI as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), after 2 years of follow-up. These findings may be partially explained by the low numbers of CD20 B cells in chronic active lesions, the limited CD20 B cell tissue turnover, and the inefficient passage of anti-CD20 antibodies across the blood-brain barrier. B cells play a critical role in MS pathogenesis. B-cell-depleting therapies have generally proven to be effective in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and in younger patients with progressive MS (PMS) with disease activity on MRI. This new study aimed to assess the less well-known effects of anti-CD20 antibody therapy on chronic, active/smoldering lesions, visible as PRL. This type of lesion is associated with clinical disease severity and neuro-axonal damage. B-cell lineage lymphocytic subpopulations in chronic, active lesions were also analyzed, including the consequences of their depletion. To do this, a longitudinal, clinical-MRI study was set up in which 4 European academic hospitals participated. Included were 68 adults with RRMS or PMS; 42 received anti-CD20 treatment, while 26 chose not to be treated. All participants underwent longitudinal 3T susceptibility-based MRI for PRL detection and quantitative-susceptibility-mapping (QSM) analysis. The median follow-up for treated and untreated participants was 26 and 31 months, respectively. Dr. Pietro Maggi (Saint-Luc University Hospital, Belgium) presented the results. A total of 346 white-matter lesions were studied: 185 PRL (133 treated and 52 untreated) and 161 non-PRL (110 treated and 51 untreated). At follow-up, the paramagnetic rim disappeared in none of the 133-treated PRL. The researchers did not find a significant treatment effect on PRL versus non-PRL for log-lesion volume (P=0.16), Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM; P=0.56), or T1 values (P=0.34). PRL were larger (P<0.0001) and expanded over time (P=0.009), ‚Äúconfirming their nasty, destructive phenotype,‚Äù Dr. Maggi said. In chronic, active lesions, lymphocytes constituted 6.8% of all immune cells; they included 4.3% of CD20 B cells, 20% of antibody-producing plasmablasts, 75.5% of activated T cells, and 0.2% of natural-killer cells. A gene-regulatory network (GRN) machine-learning analysis predicted that depletion of CD20 B cells, plasmablasts, and T cells would each affect genes highly expressed by microglia and dendritic cells. * Maggi P.

89,"From observational, single-arm cohorts, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is known to be highly efficacious in patients with highly active MS. Results of a new study comparing AHSCT to various highly efficacious, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) reveal it to be superior to fingolimod and comparable with ocrelizumab and natalizumab therapy in the prevention of relapses. In AHSCT, patients‚Äô stem cells are harvested and reinfused after high-dose chemotherapy, in an attempt to reset the immune system. In the absence of direct, randomized, comparative trials, this study compared the effectiveness of AHSCT with fingolimod, ocrelizumab, and natalizumab therapy by emulating a series of pairwise trials. Patient data were collected in 6 centers specialized in AHSCT from five countries, which were paired with patients from the MSBase registry using fingolimod, ocrelizumab, or natalizumab. The AHSCT and pharmaceutical groups were matched using a propensity score that was based on demographic factors, previous relapses, time since diagnosis, and most effective prior therapy. The main endpoints were annualized relapse rates (ARR), freedom from relapse, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) change. Professor Tomas Kalincik (University of Melbourne, Australia) presented the results. Matched patients had a mean of more than 0.9 relapses in the prior year and a mean EDSS of 3‚Äì4. Compared with 612 fingolimod users, 120 matched patients with AHSCT experienced less relapses (mean ARR 0.20 vs 0.11; HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37‚Äì0.91). The risk for EDSS worsening was not significantly different (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.16‚Äì1.54), and patients who underwent AHSCT were more likely to experience disability improvement (HR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.46-4.72). No significant differences were detected between 91 AHSCT- and 303 ocrelizumab-treated patients: ARR 0.10 versus 0.08, relapse risk 0.85 (0.46‚Äì1.56), EDSS worsening 0.41 (0.09‚Äì1.90), and EDSS improvement 2.31 (0.63‚Äì8.48). Compared with 606 natalizumab users, 116 AHSCT patients had similar results in ARR (0.12 vs 0.09), relapse risk (0.78; 0.40‚Äì1.52), and EDSS worsening (0.50; 0.09‚Äì2.61). AHSCT was, however, associated with a higher rate of EDSS improvement (1.82; 1.19‚Äì2.78), despite natalizumab being known for the reduction of disability in clinical trials. * Kalincik T, et al.

In turn, aHSCT appears to be as effective as Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) in RRMS patients and also was not superior to Tysabri in people with progressive MS. These are the findings of retrospective and comparative analyses of patients with similar demographic and clinical parameters before receiving either aHSCT or approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs).

507,"Phase II clinical trial data of evobrutinib demonstrated low disease activity and stable EDSS, with NfL levels, a marker of neuronal injury, remaining low in people with RMS after three and a half years of therapy Late-breaking data showed evobrutinib-treated patients mounted an antibody response to mRNA COVID vaccinations similar to that of healthy subjects Evobrutinib is an investigational highly-selective, oral, CNS-penetrant BTK inhibitor with the potential to become a best-in-class treatment option for people living with RMS Not intended for UK and U.S. based media (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced findings which demonstrated that annualized relapse rates (ARR) remained low and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were stable in people with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) treated with investigational evobrutinib through more than three and half years. Additionally, the number of T1 gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions and T2 lesion volume remained low for the duration of the open-label extension (OLE) of the Phase II clinical trial. These data, presented at the 38th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), suggest the long-term positive benefits of evobrutinib for people with RMS as a potential best-in-class therapy. Evobrutinib is an oral, highly selective, central nervous system (CNS) penetrant immunomodulator that has the potential to become a safe and highly efficacious treatment option for RMS by addressing both peripheral and central drivers of inflammation through inhibition of Bruton‚Äôs tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling in B cells as well as microglia. The dual-faceted approach of evobrutinib may offer better control of silent progression of the disease in between attacks on top of strong relapse control in people living with RMS. ‚ÄúDisease progression is a top concern in the MS community. Learning more about silent disease progression without relapses will help us further our understanding of MS, along with potential treatments, as it has not just physical but also cognitive and mental deleterious impact,‚Äù said Patrick Vermersch, MD, PhD, Vice President, Research in Biology and Health, University of Lille. ‚ÄúIn this longest-running and most extensive analysis of any BTK inhibitor in development for RMS, evobrutinib maintained disease stability for up to three and half years. It also has the potential to directly address smoldering inflammation in RMS which contributes to the silent causes of disease progression. It has previously shown promising results in targeting central inflammation, including through its modulatory effects on microglia.‚Äù The OLE of the Phase II clinical trial evaluated the long-term treatment effect of evobrutinib on ARR, EDSS scores and several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes, in people with RMS: Patients assigned to the initial 75mg twice-daily arm, maintained a low ARR of 0.13 throughout the course of the OLE. In addition, switching from 75mg once-daily to 75mg twice-daily in the OLE reduced ARR from 0.19 to 0.09 Overall, mean EDSS scores, as well as MRI lesion activity remained low and stable throughout the entire study These data points further strengthen the observations made previously that maximal BTK occupancy throughout the dosing interval achieved with twice-daily dosing is correlated to higher ARR reductions with evobrutinib. The Company also presented new long-term data from the Phase II clinical trial OLE which found reductions of blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, a key biomarker which may predict future brain volume loss and disease progression. Patients experienced sustained and ongoing reductions in blood NfL levels compared to the double-blind period (DBP) and OLE baseline values. A dose of 75mg twice-daily significantly reduced NfL levels from week 12 (DBP), compared to placebo/evobrutinib 25mg once-daily showing an early dose-response. This reduction in NfL provides evidence evobrutinib may reduce neuronal damage in people with RMS. ‚ÄúThis is the first time that evidence of sustained efficacy out to three and a half years could be shown with a BTK inhibitor in RMS,‚Äù said Jan Klatt, Senior Vice President, Head of Development Unit Neurology and Immunology at Merck. ‚ÄúCombined with our previous data demonstrating reduced volume of slowly expanding lesions, indicative of an effect on microglia, and reduced neurofilament levels, a marker of neuronal injury, we are confident evobrutinib has the potential to offer best-in-class efficacy for people living with RMS.‚Äù Late-breaking data from a post hoc analysis of vaccinated patients (n=24) in the Phase II OLE were also presented, showing 96% of people with RMS treated with evobrutinib (75mg twice daily) were able to mount an antibody response following two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, similar to untreated RMS patients and healthy subjects. The increase in antibody response in seronegative and seropositive patients demonstrated a preserved response to novel and recall antigens. This is the first time this could be shown with a BTK inhibitor in RMS and these findings are consistent with the modulation of B cell function, providing a potentially alternative treatment to B cell depletion approaches. About Evobrutinib Evobrutinib is an oral, highly selective CNS-penetrant inhibitor of Bruton‚Äôs tyrosine kinase (BTK) in clinical development as a potential treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). It is the first BTK inhibitor to demonstrate clinical efficacy in the largest Phase II study with follow-up beyond three years as well as demonstrate an impact on early biomarkers of ongoing central inflammation that correlate with disease progression. Evobrutinib is designed to modulate B cell responses such as proliferation and antibody and cytokine release, as well as modulate macrophage/microglia activation. It significantly reduced SEL volume and levels of blood NfL, markers of ongoing central inflammation and neurodegeneration that predict long-term disability. Evobrutinib was optimized for efficacy through the most comprehensive BTK inhibitor dose-finding study in RMS which demonstrated 75mg twice-daily dosing achieves maximal efficacy across endpoints by sustaining BTK inhibition throughout the dosing interval (>95% BTK occupancy maintained in 98% of patients before next dose). It is currently under clinical investigation and is not approved for any use anywhere in the world. About the Open-Label Extension (OLE) Phase II Clinical Trial In the 48 week double-blind period (DBP), patients with RMS were assigned to one of five treatment groups: placebo (switching to 25mg once-daily evobrutinib after 24 weeks), 25mg or 75mg once-daily evobrutinib, 75mg twice-daily evobrutinib, or open-label dimethyl fumarate (120mg twice daily for the first week and 240mg twice daily thereafter). At week 48, patients could enter the OLE and received evobrutinib 75mg once daily for a mean time of 49.8 weeks before switching to 75mg twice daily for the remainder of the OLE. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.8 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. Merck in Neurology and Immunology Merck has a long-standing legacy in neurology and immunology, with significant R&D and commercial experience in multiple sclerosis (MS). The company‚Äôs current MS portfolio includes two products for the treatment of relapsing MS ‚Äì Rebif¬Æ (interferon beta-1a) and MAVENCLAD¬Æ (cladribine tablets). Merck aims to improve the lives of patients by addressing areas of unmet medical needs. In addition to Merck‚Äôs commitment to MS, the company also has a pipeline focusing on discovering new therapies that have potential in other neuroinflammatory and immune-mediated diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).

611,"Home 2022 October Moissanite Engagement Rings In Melbourne Launches Ethical Gemstone Collection News Moissanite Engagement Rings In Melbourne Launches Ethical Gemstone Collection Moissanite Engagement Rings (0435-232-015), a boutique-grown moissanite jeweler based in Melbourne, has a new collection of ethical gemstone engagement rings. Fitzroy, Australia‚Äì(Newsfile Corp. ‚Äì October 26, 2022) ‚Äì Moissanite Engagement Rings‚Äô new ethical stone collection exclusively features ethically sourced and lab-grown moissanite of the highest quality. The renowned jeweler brings Australian customers this rare, naturally occurring mineral which bears a striking resemblance to diamonds in appearance and mineral composition, with the added advantage of possessing a broader refractive index and a rainbow-like light reflection. More details can be found at  Moissanite Engagement Rings In Melbourne Launches Ethical Gemstone Collection To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:  In its recently launched collection, Moissanite Engagement Rings offers Internationally Certified GRA Gemstones combined with recycled gold for the ultimate environmental and ethical final product. With its latest gemstone range, Moissanite Engagement Rings affirm its commitment to ethical diamond alternatives like moissanite when the traditional diamond industry remains rife with problems. According to a recent industry expos√© from CBS, blood diamonds still represent 4% of global diamond sales. Moreover, according to Human Rights Watch, 12 out of the world‚Äôs 13 largest diamond-sourcing firms were found guilty of allowing grave human rights violations to occur in their mining process. With these sobering facts in mind, Moissanite Engagement Rings believe that when a person gets down on one knee to propose, the best way to do so is with one of their new 100% ethical engagement rings. New rings that interested customers can purchase include their timeless, understated Oval Solitaire. Like most Moissanite Engagement Rings pieces, this ring is available in 14 or 18K yellow, rose or white gold, or in pure platinum. Customers can also select their preferred carat size, from a more modest 1-carat moissanite solitaire to a weighty 4.9-carat stone. For customers seeking a more dramatic look, the jeweler offers pieces like the Oval Halo With Full Pav√© or the even more unique Oval With Pronged Halo And Pav√©. Their new collection also features pear, emerald, and round-cut moissanite gemstones. Moissanite Engagement Rings display its new moissanite rings online, but they can also be viewed at its showroom in Melbourne. The boutique jeweler ships its handcrafted ethical rings across Australia. Moissanite Engagement Rings said, ‚ÄúDiscovered in a meteorite, naturally occurring moissanite is rarer than diamonds. With moissanite, which shines brighter than a diamond, you can get your dream ring with more sparkle.‚Äù More information is available at  Contact Info: Name: Jarod Guthrie Email: [email protected] Organization: Moissanite Engagement Rings Address: 425 Smith St, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065, Australia Website:  To view the source version of this press release, please visit  Continue Reading Previous Fujitsu embarks on digital collaboration with WBCSD for carbon neutral transportation Next Toronto Daegu Assets Confirm New Stockbroking Platform Launch Related Stories News Social Media New Data at ECTRIMS 2022 Highlight Biogen‚Äôs Commitment to Advancing Individualized Disease Management for People Living with MS News Kizoo invests in Rejuvenation Startup Mogling Bio News Harro H√∂fliger and LEON collaborate to bring the innovative NANOus LNP-encapsulation device to market for rapid, large-scale prophylactic vaccine manufacturing News Ryvu Therapeutics Presents Updated Clinical and Preclinical Data on RVU120 at the AACR-NCI-EORTC Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium News Byppo Technologies Inc.

645,"Phase II clinical trial data of evobrutinib demonstrated low disease activity and stable EDSS, with NfL levels, a marker of neuronal injury, remaining low in people with RMS after three and a half years of therapy Late-breaking data showed evobrutinib-treated patients mounted an antibody response to mRNA COVID vaccinations similar to that of healthy subjects Evobrutinib is an investigational highly-selective, oral, CNS-penetrant BTK inhibitor with the potential to become a best-in-class treatment option for people living with RMS Not intended for UK and U.S. based media DARMSTADT, Germany -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced findings which demonstrated that annualized relapse rates (ARR) remained low and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were stable in people with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) treated with investigational evobrutinib through more than three and half years. Additionally, the number of T1 gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions and T2 lesion volume remained low for the duration of the open-label extension (OLE) of the Phase II clinical trial. These data, presented at the 38th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), suggest the long-term positive benefits of evobrutinib for people with RMS as a potential best-in-class therapy. Evobrutinib is an oral, highly selective, central nervous system (CNS) penetrant immunomodulator that has the potential to become a safe and highly efficacious treatment option for RMS by addressing both peripheral and central drivers of inflammation through inhibition of Bruton‚Äôs tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling in B cells as well as microglia. The dual-faceted approach of evobrutinib may offer better control of silent progression of the disease in between attacks on top of strong relapse control in people living with RMS. ‚ÄúDisease progression is a top concern in the MS community. Learning more about silent disease progression without relapses will help us further our understanding of MS, along with potential treatments, as it has not just physical but also cognitive and mental deleterious impact,‚Äù said Patrick Vermersch, MD, PhD, Vice President, Research in Biology and Health, University of Lille. ‚ÄúIn this longest-running and most extensive analysis of any BTK inhibitor in development for RMS, evobrutinib maintained disease stability for up to three and half years. It also has the potential to directly address smoldering inflammation in RMS which contributes to the silent causes of disease progression. It has previously shown promising results in targeting central inflammation, including through its modulatory effects on microglia.‚Äù The OLE of the Phase II clinical trial evaluated the long-term treatment effect of evobrutinib on ARR, EDSS scores and several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes, in people with RMS: * Patients assigned to the initial 75mg twice-daily arm, maintained a low ARR of 0.13 throughout the course of the OLE. In addition, switching from 75mg once-daily to 75mg twice-daily in the OLE reduced ARR from 0.19 to 0.09 * Overall, mean EDSS scores, as well as MRI lesion activity remained low and stable throughout the entire study These data points further strengthen the observations made previously that maximal BTK occupancy throughout the dosing interval achieved with twice-daily dosing is correlated to higher ARR reductions with evobrutinib. The Company also presented new long-term data from the Phase II clinical trial OLE which found reductions of blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, a key biomarker which may predict future brain volume loss and disease progression. Patients experienced sustained and ongoing reductions in blood NfL levels compared to the double-blind period (DBP) and OLE baseline values. A dose of 75mg twice-daily significantly reduced NfL levels from week 12 (DBP), compared to placebo/evobrutinib 25mg once-daily showing an early dose-response. This reduction in NfL provides evidence evobrutinib may reduce neuronal damage in people with RMS. ‚ÄúThis is the first time that evidence of sustained efficacy out to three and a half years could be shown with a BTK inhibitor in RMS,‚Äù said Jan Klatt, Senior Vice President, Head of Development Unit Neurology and Immunology at Merck. ‚ÄúCombined with our previous data demonstrating reduced volume of slowly expanding lesions, indicative of an effect on microglia, and reduced neurofilament levels, a marker of neuronal injury, we are confident evobrutinib has the potential to offer best-in-class efficacy for people living with RMS.‚Äù Late-breaking data from a post hoc analysis of vaccinated patients (n=24) in the Phase II OLE were also presented, showing 96% of people with RMS treated with evobrutinib (75mg twice daily) were able to mount an antibody response following two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, similar to untreated RMS patients and healthy subjects. The increase in antibody response in seronegative and seropositive patients demonstrated a preserved response to novel and recall antigens. This is the first time this could be shown with a BTK inhibitor in RMS and these findings are consistent with the modulation of B cell function, providing a potentially alternative treatment to B cell depletion approaches. About Evobrutinib Evobrutinib is an oral, highly selective CNS-penetrant inhibitor of Bruton‚Äôs tyrosine kinase (BTK) in clinical development as a potential treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). It is the first BTK inhibitor to demonstrate clinical efficacy in the largest Phase II study with follow-up beyond three years as well as demonstrate an impact on early biomarkers of ongoing central inflammation that correlate with disease progression. Evobrutinib is designed to modulate B cell responses such as proliferation and antibody and cytokine release, as well as modulate macrophage/microglia activation. It significantly reduced SEL volume and levels of blood NfL, markers of ongoing central inflammation and neurodegeneration that predict long-term disability. Evobrutinib was optimized for efficacy through the most comprehensive BTK inhibitor dose-finding study in RMS which demonstrated 75mg twice-daily dosing achieves maximal efficacy across endpoints by sustaining BTK inhibition throughout the dosing interval (>95% BTK occupancy maintained in 98% of patients before next dose). It is currently under clinical investigation and is not approved for any use anywhere in the world. About the Open-Label Extension (OLE) Phase II Clinical Trial In the 48 week double-blind period (DBP), patients with RMS were assigned to one of five treatment groups: placebo (switching to 25mg once-daily evobrutinib after 24 weeks), 25mg or 75mg once-daily evobrutinib, 75mg twice-daily evobrutinib, or open-label dimethyl fumarate (120mg twice daily for the first week and 240mg twice daily thereafter). At week 48, patients could enter the OLE and received evobrutinib 75mg once daily for a mean time of 49.8 weeks before switching to 75mg twice daily for the remainder of the OLE. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.8 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common.

667,"SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.‚Äì(BUSINESS WIRE)‚ÄìAtara Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATRA), a leader in T-cell immunotherapy, leveraging its novel allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) T-cell platform to develop transformative therapies for patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases, today announced new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarker and open-label extension (OLE) clinical data from the study of ATA188, an investigational Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-targeted T-cell immunotherapy, in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). These findings will be presented as a late-breaking ePoster at the 38th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) taking place October 26-28, 2022, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. During the initial 12 months, or in the OLE, seven of the 24 patients achieved confirmed disability improvement (CDI), by expanded disability status scale (EDSS), defined as EDSS improvement versus baseline that is confirmed at two consecutive timepoints; 13 had stable EDSS and four had confirmed disability progression (CDP). Additionally, nine met sustained disability improvement (SDI) criteria, a composite scale combining confirmed improvement in either the EDSS score or timed 25-foot walk test in the initial 12-month period (n=7) or in the OLE (n=2). These data demonstrate that ATA188 continues to be well-tolerated, and safety is consistent with previous reports with no Grade >3 events, dose limiting toxicities, cytokine release syndrome, or graft versus host disease. ‚ÄúNew biomarker imaging data presented at ECTRIMS suggest brain structural changes and potential remyelination may underlie clinical disability improvements observed with ATA188 treatment,‚Äù said AJ Joshi, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Atara. ‚ÄúWe are pleased to see a majority of patients experiencing either long term durability of CDI based on EDSS improvement or long-term stability in EDSS, which would also represent a transformational profile relative to the expected natural course of the disease.‚Äù As of September 2022, patients achieving CDI continuing in the OLE have been followed for up to 46.5 months. Five of five patients continued to maintain CDI for a median of 27.5 (range, 23.8‚Äì36.7) months. Eight of eight participants with stable EDSS remaining in the OLE continued to have a stable EDSS for a median of 41.2 (36.3‚Äì48.5) months. In the study, changes in whole-brain and regional brain volumes were assessed longitudinally utilizing T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI images. Specific measures of atrophy included percentage brain volume change (PBVC), percentage ventricular volume change (PVVC, where increasing ventricular volume is indicative of increased atrophy in general, and specifically subcortical atrophy), and thalamic volume change (TVC) assessed on T1-weighted MRI. Myelin density was assessed longitudinally through nMTR images in T2 unenhancing lesions and in the normal-appearing brain tissue. During the initial 12 months: * Patients who achieved SDI (n=7) had significantly less ventricular enlargement (PVVC, p=0.019), reflecting less brain atrophy, and similar PBVC (p=0.538) and TVC (p=0.529) versus those who did not (n=16). * Similar trends were observed in patients achieving CDI, who tended to have less ventricular enlargement (PVVC; p=0.108) at 12 months while PBVC (p=0.437) and TVC (p=0.742) were similar. In a longitudinal analysis through 42 months, patients achieving CDI (versus not) had: * Significantly less decrease in PBVC over time ([95% CI: 0.02‚Äì0.66], p=0.037) and there was a trend for less ventricular volume enlargement over time ([95% CI: ‚àí0.6‚Äì0.03], p=0.074), both reflecting less brain atrophy; TVC did not differ by CDI status. * Significantly increased signal on nMTR in unenhancing T2 lesions (reflective of possible increased myelin density) ([95% CI: 0.05‚Äì0.24], p=0.005) suggesting that brain structural changes, potentially including remyelination, persist over time and may underlie the durable CDI associated with ATA188. * A trend for increased myelin density (nMTR) in normal appearing brain tissue over time ([95% CI: ‚àí0.04‚Äì0.35], p=0.112). Further detail on MRI and nMTR data as well as updated safety and efficacy data will be presented in the October 26 ePoster presentation, EP1242. In separate ePosters (EP1070 & EP1190), Atara will also present health economics and outcomes research data on the unmet need in patients with non-active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) in the U.S. and the study design, patient demographics, and healthcare resource utilization of patients with active and non-active PMS in a novel, patient-centered real-world evidence study.

EBV-infected B cells drive pathology in MS by stimulating autoreactive T cells, and by differentiating into autoreactive plasma cells. These EBV-infected B cells present in the central nervous system (CNS), driving chronic inflammation and the generation of reactive antibodies against some brain proteins. Specifically targeting EBV infected immune cells represents a new targeted approach. ATA188, Atara‚Äôs investigational off-the-shelf, allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy aims to specifically target EBV-infected B cells and plasma cells for progressive forms of MS. ATA188 is currently in a Phase 2 EMBOLD clinical study for the treatment of patients with progressive forms of MS and has met target enrollment, with final data and communication expected in October 2023. About Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. (@Atarabio) is a pioneer in T-cell immunotherapy leveraging its novel allogeneic EBV T-cell platform to develop transformative therapies for patients with serious diseases including solid tumors, hematologic cancers and autoimmune disease.

720,"Changes in cholesterol metabolism may be linked to the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) illness. However, there are many crucial issues that have still to be solved in order to demonstrate the causal link. The purpose of this study was to examine whether or not multiple sclerosis patients who have had brain MRI imaging also have had blood lipid measurements taken. Researchers enrolled 1,505 MS patients (across all MS phenotypes) in this big longitudinal research since they had access to their paired MRI and blood lipid levels (n=4,966 pairs; time difference <3 months). One 1.5-T MRI scanner was used for all patients (Gyroscan, Phillips). ScanView software was used to analyze the volumes of the whole brain and the T2 lesion. Total cholesterol, low density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triacylglycerol (TAG) were acquired in standard clinical practice to create lipid profiles. Cross-sectional analysis at baseline was done using adjusted linear regression model. The connection between imaging and lipid measurements was analyzed using linear mixed models (with random intercept for patient) with adjustments for sex, age, illness duration, EDSS, treatment status at visit, and time between MRI scans. About 70% of the participants were female, the average age was 35.9 (SD=9.77), the average duration of illness was 8.02 (SD=7.20), the median EDSS was 2.0 (IQR=2.0,3.0), and the average period of follow-up was 7.7 years. Some 17.1% of patients were not receiving any immunomodulatory therapy, while 72.3% were receiving first-line immunomodulatory treatments and 10.6% were receiving second-line immunomodulatory therapies. In longitudinal mixed model analysis, researchers identified a connection between brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) and HDL-C (b=-0.5; 95% CI: -0.51, -0.27; P=<0.001). There were significant correlations between BPF and both LDL-C (b=0.25; P=0.001) and HDL-C (b=-0.52; P=0.0012) at baseline. They also discovered correlations between (log+1) EDSS and HDL-C (b=-0.07; P=0.008) and TAG (b=0.027; P=0.011). Whole brain volume and blood lipid variations in multiple sclerosis patients are linked in this large longitudinal real-world cohort. Additional research is necessary to determine whether or not this correlation is just coincidental.

730,"BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Presents NurOwn¬Æ Phase 2 Progressive MS Biomarker Data at the 38th ECTRIMS Congress Biomarker analyses show robust increases in cerebrospinal fluid neuroprotective biomarkers following NurOwn treatment NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: BCLI), a leading developer of cellular therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that a scientific abstract titled 'NurOwn (MSC-NTF) Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Progressive MS: Effects on CSF Neuroprotective Biomarkers' will be presented at the 38th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), being held from October 26-28th in Amsterdam, NL. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analyses from the phase 2 progressive MS clinical trial demonstrate that intrathecal NurOwn treatment resulted in robust increases in CSF neuroprotective biomarkers, consistent with the proposed mechanism of action, and provide important biological context for the observed clinical trial outcomes. The poster will be presented by Jeffrey Cohen, MD, Hazel Prior Hostetler Endowed Chair and Professor of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Director, Experimental Therapeutics, Mellen Center for MS Treatment and Research.

Summary
"The European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) conference held in Milan showcased significant advancements in the understanding and management of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Researchers presented promising results from studies utilizing Ocrelizumab administered under the skin, demonstrating its potential in slowing down MS disability progression in Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients. Additionally, Vidofludimus Calcium was found to reduce nerve damage markers in RRMS individuals after only six months of treatment. Furthermore, Tiziana Life Sciences shared six-month safety and biomarker data for Intranasal Foralumab in Non-Active Secondary Progressive MS patients. Horizon Therapeutics Plc also unveiled new Uplizna (Inebilizumab-Cdon) data in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD). These findings underscore the commitment of the MS research community towards advancing the diagnosis and treatment of MS.

Several groundbreaking discoveries were presented. One such discovery is the promising results of Fenebrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, in reducing MRI lesions by 69% in MS patients. This suggests that it could provide an alternative treatment option with fewer side effects compared to standard treatments like Tysabri. Other presentations discussed advancements in cancer treatments using immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy, as well as developments in biosimilar natalizumab and non-covalent Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors for MS treatment. The conference also challenged the traditional view of MS as an autoimmune disease, suggesting instead that it should be considered a viral disease due to factors such as venous hypertension, microbleedings, inflammation, free radicals, and neurodegeneration. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy was also highlighted as a promising approach for improving cognitive processing speed and enhancing cognitive and biomarker improvements in Progressive MS patients. Lastly, the conference emphasized the significance of comorbidities in MS, revealing a higher prevalence of cerebrovascular comorbidity among MS patients compared to healthy controls, and stressing the need for targeted treatment and preventive measures to address these comorbidities."

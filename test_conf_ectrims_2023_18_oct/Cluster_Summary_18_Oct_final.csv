The conversation centers around the significance of managing symptoms to enhance the quality of life for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Dr. Bardia Nourbakhsh emphasizes the importance of addressing fatigue in MS, stating that it is a crucial topic that needs to be measured through patient-reported outcomes (PROMs). Fatigue affects 50% of women with MS, and sleep disorders are a common issue that can impact other MS symptoms. The discussion also touches upon the need to address invisible symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive reserve in MS patients. A systematic review of cognitive reserve in MS is recommended to understand the methods used and disease-related aspects.



The discussion highlights the importance of considering patient-reported outcomes when measuring fatigue in MS. Dr. Bardia Nourbakhsh stresses that there is no better measure than listening to the patient, making PROMs the gold standard. The conversation also raises awareness about the prevalence of sleep disorders among women with MS and the need to take action to address these issues. Additionally, the discussion mentions the significance of cognitive reserve and its relationship to disease-related aspects in MS patients. A systematic review of cognitive reserve in MS is suggested to gain a deeper understanding of the methods used and disease-related factors.","Fatigue management strategies and its effects on quality of life, cognitive function, and depression.","Title: ""Addressing Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Key Directions and Patient-Reported Measures""","- the quality of life for people with #ms is strongly affected by depression, fatigue, pain, muscle weakness, and memory problems! ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è this only highlights how important #symptomatic management ‚ÄºÔ∏è of #multiplesclerosis #symptoms to improve the quality of life! @ectrims @actrims https://t.co/8wwpjrxj3k,

The conversations revolve around the importance of addressing depression and comorbidities in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Dr. Ruth Ann Marrie highlights the commonality of comorbidities in MS and the need for attention towards treatment and prevention. Depression is a significant concern, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has shown benefits for depression and anxiety in MS patients, according to Dr. Feinstein. Atrophy in the hippocampus and elevated cortisol levels may contribute to depression in MS, and mental health conditions in MS are 3-4 times higher than in the general population. Adjusting to diagnosis and/or functional changes can be challenging, and it is essential to protect joy and mental wellbeing.



The discussions also focus on the role of inflammation in MS and its impact on mental health. Inflammation in the brain can cause depression, and managing comorbidities through dietary management can help delay their onset and mitigate their effects. Modifiable diseases, such as comorbidities, should receive increased attention, and EC Trims provides valuable insights into the latest developments in MS research. Proper MS management involves tackling comorbidities, and PIRA offers promising solutions for treating depression early after MS diagnosis. Breaking down pathways and exploring opportunities for early intervention is crucial, and everyone with MS deserves support for their mental health.",Comorbidities and Depression: Understanding the Progression and Treatment Pathways,"Title: ""Early Treatment of Depression in Multiple Sclerosis: Evidence and Implications""","- @dramybsullivan provided more evidence for treating depression early after #multiplesclerosis diagnosis at #ectrims2023. progression independent of disease activity #pira was all the talk in #msmilan2023 with @drjnicholas breaking down the pathways and opportunities for early tx! https://t.co/qwz23orx6t,

The discussion revolves around the improvement in malignancy prognosis due to immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy. However, these treatments can also trigger immune-related adverse events, including neurological side effects that are relatively rare but potentially severe. The announcement of six-month safety and biomarker data for intranasal foralumab in patients with non-active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (NA-SPMS) at the ECTRIMS annual congress is mentioned. The conversation touches upon various topics related to multiple sclerosis, including SPMS, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, T1DM, women's health, primary care, prevention, autoimmune diseases, and the microbiome.



The discussion highlights the impact of multi-generational exposure to pollution and insufficient sunlight prescriptions on microbiome health, brain health, and immune function. It emphasizes the importance of adequate sunlight prescriptions (infrared, UVA, UVB) tailored to each genotype, as well as the measurement of nitro-PAHs, black carbon, diesel compounds, benzene metabolites, arsenic, and fluoride. The conversation also touches upon the connection between exposure to environmental pollutants and the risk of developing autoimmune disorders, neurological disorders, and cancer. Additionally, the topic of rheumatoid arthritis and the relevance of Women's Health are briefly discussed.",Women's Health and Multiple Sclerosis: Exploring the Impact of Environmental Factors,Title: The Safety and Efficacy of Foralumab in Non-Active Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: A Six-Month Study,"- o130 @hcl_research: immune checkpoint inhibitors & car-t cell therapy have dramatically improved #malignancy prognosis. due to mechanism, both can trigger immune-related aes. neurological irae are relatively rare but potentially serious. #msmilan2023 #cancer #multiplesclerosis,

The conversations centered around the importance of addressing family planning and breastfeeding in women with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Healthcare providers should encourage exclusive breastfeeding in MS patients and include family planning in standard clinical care, taking into account patients' pregnancy desires when choosing treatment plans. A study presented at MS Milan found that nearly 80% of participants discussed pregnancy with their MS team in advance, while 68.6% were exposed to Disease Modifying Therapy (DMT) or received previous induction therapy during pregnancy. Natalizumab and glatiramer acetate were the most commonly used DMTs during pregnancy. Another abstract at MS Milan focused on medication exposure in MS pregnancies, emphasizing the significance of comprehending the concerns women have regarding pregnancy and breastfeeding in MS.


The discussion highlighted the need for healthcare providers to have an in-depth understanding of the concerns that women with MS have about pregnancy and breastfeeding. MS nurses stressed the importance of addressing these concerns and shared their experiences in doing so.

The discussion revolves around new research and developments in multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment, particularly focusing on the use of anti-CD20 therapies and biosimilar natalizumab. A recent study presented at MS Milan demonstrated the long-term efficacy of satralizumab in patients with AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD. Another study showed that the use of anti-CD20 therapies after natalizumab was effective in treating MS, with most disease progression related to PIRA. Additionally, a real-world analysis of the largest available database for pregnancy and infant outcomes in women receiving an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody for MS revealed that the treatment is well-tolerated for both mothers and children.



The conversation also touches upon the topic of biosimilar natalizumab, with a debate surrounding its use and effectiveness. Some studies suggest that biosimilar natalizumab may not be as effective as the original drug, while others argue that it has comparable efficacy and safety profiles. There is also a growing interest in using biomarkers to detect and monitor MS, as well as a shift towards earlier treatment initiation and more personalized approaches. Experts are excited about the prospect of combining different therapies to achieve better outcomes for patients with MS. Overall, the discussion highlights the rapidly evolving landscape of MS research and treatment, with a focus on improving patient care and quality of life.","Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibody Therapies in Neurology: Analysis, Pregnancy Outcomes, and Breastfeeding Considerations",Title: Satralizumab Demonstrates Long-Term Efficacy in Patients with Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type 1 and Type 2,"- new research alert! #satralizumab continues demonstrating long-term efficacy in patients with aqp4-igg seropositive #nmosd, according to a recent study presented at #msmilan2023. @actrims @ectrims @uniofoxford explore more here: https://t.co/plmfjjwroy,

 - this week members of the msif team are in milan for the #msmilan2023. today's presentations included reference to the @who decision to add ms treatments to their essential medicines list, which was made possible through global collaboration. @ectrims @actrims,

 - #ectrims is he world's largest meeting on #multiplesclerosis. this year's meeting is in milan. the first day at #msmilan2023 was packed with some great talks. the morning ""hot topic"" session on #ebv and #multiplesclerosis was was particularly interesting. https://t.co/i36ttsdhk9,

 - check out my poster p287. #msmilan2023 lymphopenia vs. normal lymphocyte counts on diroximel fumarate #drf did not impact overall efficacy. but quartile with lowest alc over 96 weeks had best gd+ & neda results. https://t.co/wtmkannmrk https://t.co/nm90qjykct,

The 2023 ECTRIMS Congress discussed various aspects of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) research, including the role of the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in causing the disease. Research suggests that EBV infection may prime the immune system to attack a brain protein called Ano2, leading to MS. Some scientists suggest that MS may be cured by targeting EBV, while others emphasize the importance of addressing symptoms through various therapies, such as detoxification and homeopathy. The conference also covered topics like the gut microbiome, biomarkers, potential future therapeutic targets, environmental, genetic, and epigenetic risk factors, AHSCT, and EbV.



Dr. T. Berger presented research on how EBV can cause MS depending on virus and host genetic predispositions. The study found that the control of molecular mimicry induced by EBV-infected B-cells is ineffective and increases MS risk by 261%. Another discussion highlight was the revelation that EC Trims #News, Day 2, featured exciting sessions on MS research topics, including EBV, environmental and genetic risk factors, biomarkers, lifestyle modifications, the gut microbiome, and much more. Additionally, Dr. Federica Esposito discussed epigenetic factors, DNA methylation, and environmental risks in MS, including smoking and obesity, which were found to accelerate epigenetic aging with immune links. Finally, Hans Lassmann emphasized the importance of brain resident CD8+ T-cells in the MS brain.","Impact of viruses like Epstein-Barr on the immune system and gut microbiome, exploring potential therapeutic targets.",Title: The ECTRIMS Conference: Reclassifying Multiple Sclerosis as a Virus and Exploring Potential Cures and Risk Factors,"- @realtalkms_jon yes judging by the science revealed at ectrims we need to strat calling ms a virus instead of autoimmune,

The 2023 ECTRIMS Congress in Milan, Italy, focused on various aspects of multiple sclerosis (MS) research and treatment. One of the most frequently discussed topics was the use of Zeposia (ozanimod) for early relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS), which showed improvement in cognitive processing speed in nearly 50% of patients according to an ad hoc interim analysis presented at the conference. Other common discussions included the inclusion of certain disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in the World Health Organization's (WHO) Essential Medicines List, as well as the recognition of NMOSD and MOGAD as distinct entities within the MS spectrum.



One of the unique discussions at ECTRIMS was the presentation of the inaugural Rachel Horne Prize for Women's Research in MS, awarded to Dr. Rhonda Voskuhl. The award recognizes outstanding contributions to MS research by female scientists and aims to promote gender equality in the field. Prof. Olga Ciccarelli also presented her work on MS at the conference, contributing to the overall progress in understanding and treating the disease. Additionally, the conference provided a platform for individuals affected by MS to share their experiences and express gratitude to researchers and clinicians for their dedication to finding new treatments and improving patient quality of life. Nicolas, a French man living with MS, expressed his appreciation for the work done by Dr. Mark Freedman and other experts in the field.","Career achievements and notable individuals in the field of Massimo Filippi, including Olga Ciccarelli and Zeposia.","Title: Zeposia Improves Cognitive Processing Speed in Early Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis Patients in Ad Hoc Interim Analysis; Dr. Rhonda Voskuhl Receives Inaugural Rachel Horne Prize for Women's Research in MS; WHO Includes Certain DMTs in Essential Medicines List; ECTRIMS Recognizes Importance of DMTs in MS Treatment; Experts in the Field Attend Conference in Milan, Italy","- cognitive processing speed improved in nearly 50% of people treated with #zeposia (@bmsnews) for early relapsing #multiplesclerosis (#rms) according to an ad hoc interim analysis presented at #msmilan2023 @ectrims @actrims. https://t.co/ckduduvrtf,

The Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF) hosted a congress in Milan, Italy, where experts in the field discussed the latest research and developments in multiple sclerosis (MS). One of the highlights was a presentation on the use of stem cells to treat lower urinary tract issues in patients with MS. The study showed remarkable improvements in patients who underwent the stem cell treatment. Another topic that gained attention was the importance of precision medicine in MS care. A neurologist shared her experience with a patient who was initially diagnosed with primary progressive MS but later found to have MOG-antibody disease after further testing. The patient's stability and lack of progression prompted the neurologist to consider alternative diagnoses.



Other discussions at the congress focused on the need for accurate diagnosis and prevention of misdiagnosis of neurogenetic diseases that may be mistaken for MS. Experts emphasized the significance of interpreting clinical, CSF, and MRI features carefully to ensure timely and correct diagnosis. Patient advocate Ellen shared her insights on the importance of effective communication between patients and neurologists, stressing the value of active listening and understanding. Additionally, there were presentations on advanced imaging techniques in MS research and clinical settings, as well as updates on upcoming events and research projects related to MS.",UCLA Neurologist Rhonda Voskuhl discusses future hopes in neurology and the importance of accurate diagnosis.,"Title: ""The Stimrouter #Neuromodulation System: Personalized Treatments for Multiple Sclerosis and the Future of Neurology""","- stimrouter #neuromodulation system shows remarkable improvements in lower urinary tract issues for patients with #multiplesclerosis based on a recent study presented at #msmilan2023. @actrims @ectrims dive into the details: https://t.co/wrj8e34meo,

The discussion revolves around Ocrelizumab, a drug used to treat Multiple Sclerosis (MS), with a focus on its dosage, effectiveness, and safety. The Optimal dosage for subcutaneous Ocrelizumab was discussed at MS Milan, and interim results from the Chimes trial showed that the drug is safe and efficient in treating Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) in Black and Hispanic patients. ECTRIMS 2023 also presented findings on the new under-the-skin Ocrevus formulation, which effectively suppresses MS activity in Phase 3 trials. Additionally, B-Cell levels and their influence on Ocrelizumab's effectiveness in Neurology were discussed, providing insights into the science behind this connection.



Unique discussions centered around the versatility of MS care with the advent of Subcutaneous Ocrelizumab, which has been deemed non-inferior to intravenous administration in relapsing and primary progressive MS. This development may impact treatment decisions for healthcare professionals. Moreover, Ocrevus side effects were a topic of interest, with some uncertainty regarding their discussion at MS Milan. Lastly, a mention of Briumvi ($TGTX) as an alternative medication for MS patients was made by a neurologist.",Ocrevus clinical trials and their outcomes for relapsing multiple sclerosis patients.,"Title: ""Optimal Dosage of Subcutaneous Ocrelizumab Uncovered in Phase 1b Ocarina i Trial and Demonstrated Noninferiority in Relapsing and Primary Progressive MS in Chimes Trial""","- the optimal dosage for subcutaneous #ocrelizumab was uncovered in findings from the phase 1b ocarina i trial and was also presented at the recent #msmilan2023. @ectrims @actrims @genentech @ocrevus_usa @hopkinsmedicine get the details: https://t.co/axl0bta9ns,

0,"The field of multiple sclerosis (MS) research continues to grow, with potential breakthroughs in treatments for progression and remyelination expected in the next few years. The 40th congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) will take place next year. MS is a mysterious autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. Recent research has shown that chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) is a major contributor to MS, and that treating this condition can lead to improvements in symptoms and disease progression. Stem cell therapy is also being explored as a potential treatment for MS, with the goal of repairing the neurological damage caused by the disease. The vagus nerve is also being studied as a potential target for MS treatment, with microglial mirna being a focus of research. The latest research in MS is being presented at the ECTRIMS meeting in Milan, with a focus on spinal cord lesions, volume, and the spinal cord reserve.","Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) research and treatment options, including Horizon Therapeutics' Uplizna.","Title: ""Breakthroughs in Multiple Sclerosis Research: Potential Treatments for Progression and Remyelination Expected in the Next Few Years""","hopefully, breakthroughs in treatments (for progression, remyelination etc.) in the next few years will mean the end of ectrims. next year will be the 40th congress! ms research still seems to be a growth industry - good for professors, phd students and pharma profits.,

1,"The dedication to advancements in multiple sclerosis research and patient care at MS Milan is truly remarkable. Bridging science and clinical practice is vital for improving health outcomes. In a small clinical trial, five of six people with secondary progressive MS treated with Ocrevus experienced no disease activity over six months. However, current efforts to advance health equity via MS clinical trial participation are inadequate, with a lack of inclusion and representation being an obstacle to effectively understand safety, benefits, and treatment response across the MS population. Patient-reported outcomes are a crucial topic at MS Milan, with the person with MS capturing their own changes being a practical, low-cost, high-potential way to track progression and efficacy of intervention. MS Milan presented data from the PH3 ULTIMATE I & II trials of Ublituximab in MS this week, with three presentations at booth C15.

13,"The scientific summary of the ECTRIMS conference highlights the need to reclassify multiple sclerosis (MS) as a virus instead of an autoimmune disease. Research shows that infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may prime the immune system to accidentally attack a brain protein called Ano2, leading to MS. To cure and prevent MS, it is necessary to understand its origin and develop effective treatments. While EBV may be necessary but not sufficient to cause MS, there are many ways to cure diseases, and knowledge of the cause is not always necessary. The conference also explores topics such as the gut microbiome, biomarkers, potential future therapeutic targets, environmental, genetic, and epigenetic risk factors, and the relationship between EBV and MS.","Impact of viruses like Epstein-Barr on the immune system and gut microbiome, exploring potential therapeutic targets.",Title: The ECTRIMS Conference: Reclassifying Multiple Sclerosis as a Virus and Exploring Potential Cures and Risk Factors,"yes judging by the science revealed at ectrims we need to strat calling ms a virus instead of autoimmune,

 - infection with the epstein-barr virus may prime the immune system to accidentally attack a brain protein called ano2, research shows.,

 - to cure & to perhaps vaccinate to prevent origin is required; otherwise its all symptom management. might be longer term relief, but the disease is not cured,

 - ms caused by different things in different people, usually by the epstein-barr virus. but there are many ways to cure diseases. you dont even necessarily need to know the cause in order to cure disease. detox, homeopathy, etc.,

 - t. berger: great research on how ebv can cause ms depending on virus and host genetic predispositions. in these cases, the control of molecular mimicry induced by ebv-infected b-cells is ineffective and increases ms risk by 261 ! ms milan will be published in cell,
